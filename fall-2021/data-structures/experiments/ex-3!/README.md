# Problem: Evaluation Arithmetic
- Some of the arithmetic operations has precedence over others 


## Operator precendence
- In this problem '*', '+' and '-' are valid operations.
- '*' has precedence over '+' and '-'.

## Associativity
- In same precedence group, operations is performed from lef to right.  
	(x - y) + z rather than x - (y + z)

### Solutions

1. Strategy 1: Use Stack
- Push each operator on the stack, but first pop and
perform higher and equal precedence operations.

2. Strategy 2: Use Stack
